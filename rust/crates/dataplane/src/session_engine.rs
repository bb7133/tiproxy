//! The production session owner (DPL-04): composes the DPL-01
//! [`SessionLoop`] FSM with real `MySQL` wire I/O, control-plane routing,
//! and the CTL-06 terminal-effect notices.
//!
//! # Ownership
//!
//! One **engine task** owns every socket byte: both halves of the
//! client stream and, once dialed, of the backend. Bytes never cross
//! tasks. The [`SessionLoop`] owns the FSM in its own task; classified
//! [`SessionEvent`]s flow engine → loop over a one-slot channel into
//! the DPL-01 pump (the engine reads at most one frame beyond the last
//! event it handed over — exactly the pump's own classify-one-ahead
//! contract), and [`SessionEffect`]s flow loop → engine over a bounded
//! FIFO. Phase progression is command-gated: after the
//! `ClientHandshakeResponse` event the engine performs no backend work
//! until the FSM's `DialBackend` effect arrives.
//!
//! # Forward-then-observe
//!
//! Response bytes stream backend → client with a bounded 23-byte
//! prefix capture; classification runs on the captured metadata after
//! the packet is on the wire, exactly like Go (which parses while
//! forwarding). The FSM's `Forward*` effects therefore execute as
//! ordering acknowledgements: the effect confirms the FSM authorized
//! what the wire already carried. An effect the engine cannot honor in
//! its phase ends the session as a proxy-internal error — never a
//! silent divergence.
//!
//! # Authentication
//!
//! The multi-round backend authentication relay (auth switch, extra
//! data) is engine-internal via [`AuthRelay`]; the FSM observes only
//! the terminal `BackendAuthOk`/`BackendAuthFailed`, per the SES-00
//! vocabulary.
//!
//! # Slice scope (recorded for review)
//!
//! This slice serves the TLS-capable, uncompressed path. The greeting
//! advertises `SSL` iff this session's snapshot carries a frontend TLS server
//! config; when the client sends a strict `SSLRequest`, TLS is activated in
//! place on the client leg (and, per the backend TLS plan, on the backend leg
//! before any credential leaves) with the `MySQL` sequence continuing across
//! the upgrade. An `SSLRequest` against a greeting that withheld `SSL`, or a
//! malformed one, fails closed with no plaintext fallback. Compression is
//! advertised (`COMPRESS` + `ZSTD`) and, when a client negotiates it, activated
//! at the auth-OK boundary on each leg independently (WIRE-activation C); the
//! compressed sequence is slaved to the packet sequence and reset once per
//! command. `COM_CHANGE_USER` runs its backend-challenged auth relay on the
//! same single socket owner and commits identity/prepared state only after the
//! final OK. `COM_STMT_PREPARE` streams its special multi-packet response and
//! registers statement metadata only after the terminal success boundary. A
//! control redirect executes the bounded `SHOW SESSION_STATES` exchange at
//! the FSM safe boundary, validates the signed token/session JSON, dials and
//! authenticates the exact gate-admitted target with `tidb_session_token`,
//! restores the escaped state, and only then atomically replaces the backend
//! owner. Candidate-side failures drop the candidate while preserving the
//! aligned old backend; an old-backend disconnect or incomplete snapshot
//! response closes the poisoned session.
